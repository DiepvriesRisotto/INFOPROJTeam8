            <h2>Feynman technique</h2>
            <p>To practice the Feynman technique, start by choosing a concept you want to learn, such as Newton's First Law of Motion. Write the concept at the top of a page and explain everything you know about it in simple language, as if teaching it to a child. Identify any gaps or areas where your explanation is unclear. Study these areas further until you can explain them clearly. Rewrite your explanation, simplifying complex ideas. Continue this process of reviewing and refining until you can explain the entire concept in clear, simple terms. For example, if explaining Newton's First Law, you might start with "Newton's First Law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force." After refining, it could become "A toy car won't move unless you push it, and if you push it, it will keep moving the same way until something stops it."

                <br><br>By following these steps, you will deepen your understanding of the concept through teaching and simplification.</p>
